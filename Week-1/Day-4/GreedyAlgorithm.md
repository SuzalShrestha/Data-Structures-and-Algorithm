# What is Greedy Algorithm?

Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving heuristic that makes the best local choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, it is an algorithm that makes the best choice at each step with the hope of finding the best solution for the whole problem.

## Steps to Solve a Greedy Algorithm Problem

1. **Identify the Problem**: Understand the problem statement and the constraints involved.
2. **Define the Objective Function**: Determine the objective function that needs to be optimized.
3. **Identify the Greedy Choice Property**: Determine the property that allows us to make a greedy choice at each step.
4. **Develop a Greedy Algorithm**: Design an algorithm that makes the greedy choice at each step.
5. **Prove the Correctness of the Algorithm**: Prove that the greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution.
6. **Analyze the Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity of the greedy algorithm.
7. **Implement the Algorithm**: Implement the greedy algorithm in your preferred programming language.
8. **Test the Algorithm**: Test the algorithm with different test cases to verify its correctness.
9. **Optimize the Algorithm**: Optimize the algorithm if necessary to improve its efficiency.
