# Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap (C++)

This repository accompanies your learning journey through the Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap on Coursera, offered by San Diego University. It serves as a collaborative space for you and others to explore DSA concepts, practice code implementations, and share insights.

## Structure

The repository is organized by week, with each week containing folders for each day's lessons:

## Data Structures and Algorithms

`
  ├── week-1/
  │   ├── day-1/
  │   │   ├── code/ (Your C++ code implementations)
  │   │   └── notes.md (Explanation of day 1 concepts)
  │   ├── day-2/
  │   │   └── ... (similar structure)
  │   └── ... (more weeks)
  └── ...
`

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute your code implementations and notes as you progress through the course. This fosters a community of learners who can benefit from each other's work.

### Before Contributing

Ensure your code is well-commented and formatted for readability.
Provide clear explanations in your notes, focusing on key concepts and practical examples.

## Running the Code

Specific instructions for running the code will vary depending on your development environment. However, here are some general steps:

* Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
* Set Up Environment: Install any necessary compilers, libraries, or tools required for C++ development.
* Compile Code: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code files within each code/ folder.
* Execute: Run the compiled executables to test your implementations.

## Additional Notes

Consider using a version control system like Git to track your changes and collaborate effectively.
Feel free to suggest improvements or request clarifications in the Issues section of the repository.
This repository is constantly evolving as you learn new concepts.

## Happy Learning

This README provides a clear structure for your repository and encourages collaboration among learners on the same DSA journey. Remember to update the instructions for running the code based on your specific setup.
